## Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium that is known to cause tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world‚Äôs most dangerous infectious diseases and contributes to about two million annual deaths globally. Mutational changes in the genome of M. tuberculosis strains is one of the major contributing factors to its multidrug resistance nature and increased virulence. The genomics-two-B team recreated a galaxy tutorial on M. tuberculosis bacterium variant calling which aims at checking singe nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DNA sequence of M. tuberculosis strains by comparing to an ancestral genome. This markdown contains the comprehensive step-wise procedure carried out during the recreation of the tutorial.

## Get Your Data

The data for the tutorial can be obtained using two methods;
1. By pasting the zenodo link to the data library on galaxy upload manager through the paste/fetch option.
     
     >> copy the zenodo link
     
     >> open the galaxy upload manager and select the fetch/paste option
     
     >> Click on the start option and close the upload window
     
2. By uploading the downloaded dataset from one's computer library
     
     >> Click on the galaxy upload manager
     
     >> Navigate to the choose from local file option
     
     >> Select the files to be uploaded and click on start
     
     >> Close the upload window

## Quality Control
This step serves to identify possible issues with the raw sequenced read input data before embarking on the ‚Äúreal‚Äù analysis steps
Some of the typical problem, with NGS data can be mitigated by preprocessing affected sequencing reads before trying to map them to the reference genome. Detecting possible severe problems early may at least save you a lot of tone spent on analysing low quality data that is not worth the effort.
Here is how we perform a standard quality check on our input data and only point out a few interesting aspect about that data.
### FastQC
Search and select [FastQC üîß‚öôÔ∏è] from tools list and fill in the details below

>‚ÄúShort read data from your current history‚Äù: select both FASTQ datasets
>Ensure the top part where ‚Äúshort read data from your current history‚Äù is selected.
>Leave all other parameters at their default values and click Execute.

The result should be four new datasets

One with the calculated raw data
and another with an HTML report of the findings for each input dataset.
This will get added to your history.
While one could examine the quality control report for each set of reads (forward and reverse) independently, it is quite useful to examine them side by side using the MultiQC TOOL

---
### [`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/) 

1. Search and select **`MultiQC- üõ†Ô∏è`** from the tools list and fill in the details as below

     >Results

      >`Which tool was used generate logs?` **_FastQC_**
      >> FastQC output
      
      >> `Type of FastQC output?` **_Raw data_**
      
      >>>`Output of BAMtools` **_FastQC on data: RawData_** (Select both RawData files)
2. Keep the rest parameters unchanged
3. Then **`Execute‚òëÔ∏è`**
4. Observe the output MultiQC webpage file by clicking on üëÅÔ∏è button on the file



### [**_quality trimming_**] 
1. Search and select Trimmomatic from the search tools. The process is as shown below:

‚ÄúSingle-end or paired-end reads?‚Äù: Paired End (two separate input files)
param-files ‚ÄúInput FASTQ file (R1/first of pair)‚Äù: 004-2_1.fastq.gz
param-files ‚ÄúInput FASTQ file (R2/second of pair)‚Äù: 004-2_2.fastq.gz
Select Trimmomatic operation to perform
Keep the default value of Sliding window trimming and adjust the average quality required to 30
‚Äú+Insert Trimmomatic Operation‚Äù
‚ÄúSelect Trimmomatic operation to perform‚Äù: Drop reads below a specified length (MINLEN)
‚ÄúMinimum length of reads to be kept‚Äù: 20
Click on Execute
Inspect the output produced by Trimmomatic

## Look For Contamination with Kraken2 (Optional)

Looking for contamination in our reads is essential to producing a good work, as other sources of DNA accidentally or inadvertantly get mixed in with our sample and this can  confound our snp analysis. Kraken 2 is an effective way of looking at which species is represented in our reads and so we can easily spot possible contamination of our sample. 
The already trimmed sequences were used in the kraken analysis highlighting both the 
-Forward Stand and the Reverse strand
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/adedoyinsoye/image/upload/v1629442271/HACKBIO/Screenshot_19_t6vvut.png)
A report of the analysis was produced later on; 
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/adedoyinsoye/image/upload/v1629442272/HACKBIO/Screenshot_20_aly0hu.png)
From the report generated; it was infered that about 91% of the reads were positively identified as Mycobacterium. The others found were bacteria from the same kingdom. There were no contaminating human or viral sequences detected.


## Find Variants with Snippy
###Snippy(Finding variant using Snippy)
1. Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_ancestral_reference.gbk dataset was used as the reference sequence‚Äù: 

2.Paired was selected for the end reads

3.first set of reads wa selected as Trimmomatic on X (R1 paired)

4.Second set of reads was selected as Trimmomatic on X (R2 paired)
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/adedotun/image/upload/v1629387169/samples/hackbio%20task/snippy_1_uynhgv.png)

5.In the ‚ÄúAdvanced parameters‚Äù, ‚ÄúMinimum proportion for variant evidence‚Äù was adjusted to 0.1, so we can see possible rare variants in the sample
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/adedotun/image/upload/v1629387173/samples/hackbio%20task/snippy_2_cjs4h1.png)

6.Under ‚ÄúOutput selection‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe final annotated variants in VCF format‚Äù, ‚ÄúA simple tab-separated summary of all the variants‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe alignments in BAM format‚Äù were selected

7. It was executed to show one of the following results
In a total of 1086 variants the first variant on the list is a Substitution of a C to a T which is supported by 134 reads.
